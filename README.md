## Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v3.2)](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3-2) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

## How to use

Execute `npm i` with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or you can search for another way with yarn or else.

Then you can run the project on localhost with run `npm run dev`. Access `localhost:3000` to view the site.

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
